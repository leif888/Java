RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a method that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models to improve the quality of generated outputs. In a typical RAG setup, the model can retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of documents or a knowledge base and use this information to augment its response generation.

Hereâ€™s how it works in a nutshell:

Retrieval: When a query is made, the system retrieves contextually relevant passages from a document store or database.
Generation: The retrieved information is then fed into a generative model, like a transformer-based model, which uses this information along with the original query to generate a response.
This approach can lead to more accurate and contextually appropriate outputs because the model has access to specific information that can help inform its response. It's particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to provide precise answers based on a vast amount of data, such as in question answering systems, customer support chatbots, or knowledge management systems.

By integrating RAG, you can leverage a smaller, potentially less powerful generative model effectively because the retrieval component provides the necessary context to enhance the generation process.
