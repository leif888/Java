RetrievalQA
RetrievalQA typically refers to a system where you have a question-answering model that uses a retriever to fetch relevant documents or passages from a corpus. The model then processes these documents to generate answers to the questions posed by users. This approach is direct and focused on answering one question at a time.

Usage: It's suitable for scenarios where the user asks a single question and expects a single, precise answer.
Context Handling: Does not inherently handle conversation context; each question is treated independently of any previous interactions.

ConversationalRetrievalChain
On the other hand, ConversationalRetrievalChain is designed to maintain a chain of thought across multiple interactions, allowing it to handle conversations where the context from previous exchanges can influence subsequent questions and answers.
