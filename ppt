A Vector Database, also known as an embedding database or a semantic database, is a type of database that stores and manages vectors instead of traditional tabular data. Vectors in this context are multi-dimensional numerical arrays that can represent various types of information, such as the meaning of words or sentences, images, or any other entity that can be converted into numerical form.

"chunking" refers to the process of dividing large pieces of data into smaller, manageable parts called "chunks."
Text Processing: In NLP tasks, long texts might be chunked to make them easier to handle by models. This can involve splitting documents into sentences or paragraphs, or breaking text into fixed-size segments for processing.
------------
"embedding" refers to the process of converting discrete pieces of information, such as words or sentences, into numerical vectors that capture the semantic meaning of the input data.
Document Embeddings: These capture the meaning of longer texts, such as articles or books. They can be created by averaging word embeddings or using models specifically designed for document-level semantics.
