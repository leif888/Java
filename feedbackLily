If the manager you're referring to is overseeing the new team to which you've been temporarily assigned, then your feedback can be particularly valuable for improving the integration and effectiveness of temporary assignments within their team. Here are some points you might want to address:

Integration Experience: Describe how smoothly the transition to the new team went. Did the manager make efforts to introduce you to the team and clarify your role and responsibilities?
Communication: Evaluate the lines of communication with the manager. Were updates and expectations clearly communicated? How often did you receive feedback, and was it constructive?
Task Relevance: Assess whether the tasks assigned to you aligned with your skills and capabilities. Did you find the work meaningful and relevant to your expertise?
Support and Resources: Note the level of support provided by the manager in terms of access to necessary resources, tools, and information needed to perform the tasks.
Work Environment: Share your observations about the work environment and culture within the new team. Was the atmosphere conducive to productivity and collaboration?
Training and Development: Mention any opportunities for learning and professional growth that arose during the assignment. If there were none, suggest ways in which such opportunities could be created.
Challenges Faced: Identify any obstacles you encountered and how they were addressed by the manager. Were there delays or issues that could have been handled differently?
Suggestions for Future Assignments: Provide recommendations on how similar temporary assignments could be better managed in the future. This could include clearer guidelines, better resource allocation, or improved communication strategies.
Team Feedback: If applicable, include any feedback you received from the new team regarding your contributions. This can help the manager understand the impact of the temporary assignment on the team dynamic.
Remember to frame your feedback constructively and professionally, focusing on specific examples and situations rather than making generalizations. Highlighting both positive aspects and areas for improvement will give the manager a balanced view of your experience.
