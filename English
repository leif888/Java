"As a member of the BigQuery Cost Optimization Team, I became highly interested in the initiative when the Data Mesh Team proposed it, given my involvement in a mesh producer project where cost savings are a priority. Throughout this endeavor, I gained valuable insights, particularly in BigQuery query optimization. I extend my gratitude to Scarlett for organizing such a fantastic and enriching activity."
