"As a member of the BigQuery Cost Optimization Team, I became highly interested in the initiative when the Data Mesh Team proposed it, given my involvement in a mesh producer project where cost savings are a priority. Throughout this endeavor, I gained valuable insights, particularly in BigQuery query optimization. I extend my gratitude to Scarlett for organizing such a fantastic and enriching activity."

"We are aware of BigQuery's robust capabilities, which often allow us to obtain quick results without optimizing queries. This ease can inadvertently lead to overlooking query optimization, resulting in higher costs. To address this issue, we collected all the queries executed by tenants and identified those with higher costs. We then submitted these queries to a sophisticated model for optimization suggestions. After testing the optimization results for the top-cost queries, we found that we could significantly reduce costs."
